        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <p>The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along
          with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the
          northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Chicken as a meat has
          been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken
          was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.
          For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have
          been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere, including
          capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in
          blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions
          cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar. In the United
          States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and
          it was "sought by the rich because so costly as to be an
          uncommon dish." Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during
          World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe,
          consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996,
          linked to consumer awareness of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
          (mad cow disease). 357 million tonnes of meat were produced in
          2021, 53% more than in 2000, with chicken meat representing more
          than half the increase. Chicken meat was the most produced type of
          meat in 2021 just ahead of pig meat.</p>

        <h3>Beef</h3>
        <p>People have eaten the flesh of bovines since prehistoric times; some
          of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show
          aurochs in hunting scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide
          ready access to beef, milk, and leather. Cattle have been
          domesticated at least twice over the course of evolutionary history.
          The first domestication event occurred around 10,500 years ago with
          the evolution of Bos taurus. The second was more recent, around
          7,000 years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indian
          subcontinent. There is a possible third domestication event 8,500
          years ago, with a potential third species Bos africanus arising in
          Africa. In the United States, the growth of the beef business was
          largely due to expansion in the Southwest. Upon the acquisition of
          grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the
          expulsion of the Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest,
          the American livestock industry began, starting primarily with the
          taming of feral and semi-feral longhorn cattle. Chicago and New York
          City were the first to benefit from these developments in their
          stockyards and in their meat markets.</p>

      <!-- Sushi Section -->
      <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 section" id="sushi">
        <h3>Sushi</h3>
        <p>The origin of sushi dates back to South Asia, where boiled rice was
          used to cook and preserve fish. Cleaned and cut into small pieces of
          fish was sprinkled with salt and mixed with rice, then placed under
          a press of stones, which after a few weeks was replaced by a lid.
          The lactic fermentation of the rice and fish took place over a
          period of several months, making the fish fit to eat for a year.
          Rice that turned into a gluey mass with an unpleasant odor was
          discarded or used to cook a new batch of fish. Around the 7th
          century, through China and Thailand, this method of preservation
          spread to Japan. The tradition of eating sauerkraut or pickled fish
          has survived to the present day in South Asian countries. The
          Chinese character for sushi means “pickled fish,” but the tradition
          of such preparation has been lost in China itself. In Japan,
          narezushi is currently prepared in a similar way. In the 17th
          century, rice sushi appeared, which included boiled rice, rice malt,
          seafood and vegetables. Soon, rice vinegar began to be prepared and
          added to the rice, which eliminated the fermentation process and
          greatly reduced the cooking time of sushi. In the XIX century, the
          cook Yohei Hanai from Tokyo decided to completely abandon marinating
          fish and serve fish raw. The process of cooking the dish was reduced
          to a few minutes. The new sushi quickly gained popularity, and two
          styles of cooking the dish appeared. The first was called Kansai -
          after the Osaka city district, the second was called Edo (which was
          the name of Tokyo until 1868). Diners and restaurants that served
          sushi quickly sprang up, and stores began selling specially
          processed rice for home sushi making. Since then, the process of
          making sushi has not fundamentally changed, only new recipes and
          ingredients for the dish have appeared. The last major milestone in
          the history of sushi was the introduction in the 1980s of automatic
          sushi-making machines, so-called sushi robots, invented in the late
          1970s.</p>
